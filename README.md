# (Java/Arduino) Light, Temperature, and Humidity Real-Time Graphing

## The Problem
My fiancé wants to start a garden in the backyard so that we can stop eating out at Chik-fil-A, Chili's, and Chipotle every day. I want to assist but I do not want to garden, so I decided to create a light, temperature, and humidity data interface that will optimize the watering and feeding cycle of the garden.

<b>EDIT: My fiancé informed me that this is too "try-hard" for a simple garden, I disagree, and that she will NOT be using my hardware/software... Now I have something to prove!</b>

## The Hardware

For this project I decided to use Arduino-UNO and various low voltage sensors to make the device compact
